# Master Thesis in Computational Astrophysics
These are the codes I realized for my master thesis in Computational Astrophisics.

I carried out several simulations regarding the evolution in time of stellar populations. To do this I adopted the C++ population synthesis code SEVN [(Iorio et al., 2023)] (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524..426I/abstract). From these simulations I obtained a large amount of data (~1TB) that I processed and analysed developing the Python scripts contained in the folder [master-thesis-project/SEVN_data_analysis/](https://github.com/raffscala/master-thesis-project/tree/main/SEVN_data_analysis)
