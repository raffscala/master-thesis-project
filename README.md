# Master Thesis in Computational Astrophysics ðŸŒŸ
In this repository I present the codes I realized for my master thesis in Computational Astrophysics. In this work, through computational methods, I studied the occurrences and the characteristics of peculiar supernova types: the **pair insatibility** and **pulastional pair instability supernova**. From the scientific point of view these events are very interesting because we have never observed them with our telescopes and, moreover, they originate from extremely massive stars (more than a hundred solar masses).

During my work I carried out **several simulations** regarding the evolution in time of stellar populations. In order to do this, I adopted the **object-oriented C++ code SEVN** [(Iorio et al., 2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524..426I/abstract). SEVN is parallelised with OpenMP and I ran it in parallel on a cluster using the workload manager **Slurm**. As results of the simulations I obtained a **large amount of data** (~1TB) divided in many files. I processed and analyzed all the output files developing the Python codes, stored in the folder [SEVN_data_analysis](https://github.com/raffscala/master-thesis-project/tree/main/SEVN_data_analysis), by means of packages such as **pandas**, **numpy** and **re**.<br>
Furthermore, I **updated the Python code Cosmorate** [(Santoliquido et al., 2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.4877S/abstract), that was meant for different aims with respect to mine, to evaluate the occurrences of the supernovae during the Universe history. In order to make use of Cosmorate I needed to **generate proper input files** starting from the output files of my SEVN simulations. The codes I developed for this purpose are stored in the folder [cosmorate_initial_conditions](https://github.com/raffscala/master-thesis-project/tree/main/cosmorate_initial_conditions).<br>
Lastly in the folder [plot](https://github.com/raffscala/master-thesis-project/tree/main/plot) I reported the plots representing my results and the scripts I wrote to creat them in volving packages like **matplotlib** and **numpy**.
